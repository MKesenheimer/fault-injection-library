# Customize your Pico Glitcher

In some cases the functionality findus provide will not be sufficient and you have to write your own code. 

## Pico Glitcher v1 GPIO pin overview

The Pico Glitcher v1 is built from these components:

The GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi Pico are connected to the following outlets:

| GPIO Pin | Function                                                  |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

## Pico Glitcher v1 GPIO pin header

If you want to write code for additional communication protocols, such as a UART-to-USB adapter, or an SPI-to-USB adapter, then the unused GPIO pins are perfect for that.
The output pins with level-shifting are `GPIO2` - `GPIO7`. For inputs the pins `GPIO8` - `GPIO14` can be used.

## Pico Glitcher v2 GPIO pin overview

Of course, the second revision of the Pico Glitcher can also be modified to suit your needs. Unfortunately, for better routing on the PCB and with added features, the GPIO pin assignment is different to version 1. Hence, code written for version 1 will likely not run on version 2.

The Pico Glitcher v2 is built from the following components:

The GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi Pico are connected to the following outlets:

| GPIO Pin | Function                                                    |

## Pico Glitcher v2 GPIO pin header

If you want to write code for additional communication protocols, such as a UART-to-USB adapter, or an SPI-to-USB adapter, then the unused GPIO pins are perfect for that.
Pins `GPIO16` - `GPIO19` are connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico without a level shifter and can be used bi-directionally.
The output pins with level-shifting are `GPIO4` - `GPIO9`. For inputs with level shifter the pins `GPIO15`, `GPIO20` and `GPIO21` can be used.

## Modify the MicroPython script

Add your modifications to `PicoGlitcher.py` ([https://github.com/MKesenheimer/fault-injection-library/blob/master/findus/firmware/PicoGlitcher.py](https://github.com/MKesenheimer/fault-injection-library/blob/master/findus/firmware/PicoGlitcher.py), or `fault-injection-library/findus/firmware/PicoGlitcher.py` if you cloned the whole repository) and upload the MicroPython script to the Raspberry Pi Pico:

```bash
cd findus/firmware
upload --port /dev/tty.<rpi-tty-port> --files PicoGlitcher.py AD910X.py Globals.py \ 
    PulseGenerator.py Spline.py FastADC.py <config-path>/config.json
```
