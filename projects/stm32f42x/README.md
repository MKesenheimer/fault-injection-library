# Notes

## Short Summary
- Capacitors V_CAP_1 and V_CAP_2 have to be removed. Glitch is inserted on V_CAP line.
- Successful glitches and memory dumps in the following parameter range (ChipWhisperer Pro):
```bash
python pro-glitcher.py --target /dev/<target-tty-port> --delay 90_500 91_500 --length 230 240
```
- Flash gets erased occasionally while glitching -> target has to be reprogrammed.
- PCROP register gets set occasionally while glitching -> bootloader memory responses are masked with zeros.
- PCROP register must be unset if it is set during a glitching attempt.
- Bootloader code (address 0x1fff0000) can be dumped and reverse engineered.
